# 🍽️ **MessMate Web Application**


MessMate Web Application is a full-stack food ordering and mess management platform designed to simplify daily meal ordering for users. The application allows users to browse mess menus, place food orders, manage subscriptions, and track order status in real time through a clean and responsive web interface.

This project is part of the MessMate ecosystem, which also includes separate Android applications for vendors and customers—similar in concept to platforms like Zomato / Swiggy, but optimized for mess-based food services.
